# portugese_bank_term_deposit

Case Study

Problem statement:
In this case study, you need to use the direct marketing campaigns data of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed by the client.
The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term product (variable Y).

Deliverable requirements:
1. Provide exploratory data analysis (EDA) for data insights and to support your modeling decisions
2. Provide rationales for your data preparation decisions (e.g., missing imputation, one-hot encoding, etc.)
3. Run the model using at least 2 machine learning algorithms (one of them must be logistic regression)
a. Compare your model performance
b. Tell us which algorithm you’d choose for implementation and why
4. Provide some use cases that demonstrate business value of your analysis for the bank
5. If you could ask the bank for any additional data to solve the problem, what data would you ask and why?

Data Set Information:
The dataset contains 41,188 rows and 21 columns in .csv format.

Attribute Information:

Input variables:
data that is specific to each client: 
1 - age (numeric) 
2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown') 
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed) 
4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown') 
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown') 
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown') 
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown') 

related with the last contact of the current campaign: 
8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') 
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec') 
10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri') 
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call, y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
Data that is not client specific: 
12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact) 
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted) 
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric) 
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success') 

social and economic context attributes 
16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric) 
17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric) 
20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric) Output variable (desired target): 
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
